    material: Oak
    year: 2003
    paragraphs:
      - 'I am fascinated by Windsor style which has almost no flat surfaces: it requires thoroughly shaving. This chair was made as a copy of an existent model by exact measuring. To make the spindles, I used a copy lathe, and I sculpted the seat gradually with violin planes.'
      - 'The low-back is a style of Windsor that never lost its popularity in America and it revived in the mid-nineteenth century under the nickname ‘captain’s chair’ or ‘firehouse Windsor’. This is a copy of a captain’s chair.'

    material: 'Oak (Whiskey cask), Beech / Handle: Iron'
    year: 2003
    paragraphs:
      - 'The theme was to recycle a whiskey cask while using its form and to combine it with iron work. To make a handle, I heated an iron bar on burning coal to be able to shape it　 on anvil by hitting, and welded it to the shaft parts. The centre shaft allows the iron handle to rotate a 180 degrees in order to store records easily.'

I would like to counter these disadvantages by pointing out the advantages: for example, because of the low heat conduction, with a wooden spoon you can enjoy hot soup pleasantly. I am still searching for good applications of wooden kitchenware.'

      - 'Additional information about veneered furniture: animal glue is used to glue veneer. Animal glue was the traditional adhesive before white glue. There are some different kinds of animal glue. To glue veneer, hide glue is chosen because of its elastic bonds. Wood will always keep moving according to atmospheric relative humidity, and hide glue has the flexibility to follow this movement. Recently, the regulation of room temperature by heating systems is responsible for super dryness in winter, resulting in splitting wood and perishing animal glue.'

I prepared new veneer for the full length of the front surface and laid them out successively according to the pattern of grain. 7 drawers show continuously a whole grain of Mahogany.

      - 'I removed old polish layers, and replaced missing veneer and brass strips. I filled splits with massive mahogany, took care of the movement of the cylinder. I polished it again with shellac.'
      - 'The cause of splits on the surface of veneer lies in the wooden base which is restricted in movement until splits relieve the stress. These splits affect the veneer surface too.'
      - 'Inlaid metal can loosen from veneered furniture because of less bonding strength between wood and metal, and lesser capacity of movement than wood.'
      - 'There is a difficulty to inlay metal because of heat conduction which deforms thin sheets and strips of metal while animal glue is used hot and clamped with heated block. Moreover, friction heat by sanding makes the metal warm and reactivates the animal glue, resulting in the metal inlay to come off again. There is an alternative animal glue which has a very high glueing effect; fish glue modified for cold use.'
